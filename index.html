            <h1>Happy Birthday My Beloved One</h1>
            <p>
                Today, June 21st, the stars seem to shine a little brighter, just like the day you were born. You’re the poetry in my chaos, the calm in my storms, and the light I never knew I needed.
                Thank you for painting my world with colors I thought I’d never see. On your special day, I hope the universe wraps you in warmth, answers your quiet prayers, and leads you gently to every dream you’ve ever dared to dream.
                You’re magic in human form and I’m endlessly lucky to love you. Happy birthday, my forever muse.
            </p>

                <h3>Where It All Began</h3>
                <p>
                   You know, the first time I ever interacted with you was during that group bonding event. We were in the same team for the water relay game, and you were right next to me. That’s when I really saw you — and I was so drawn to you. You were the only girl who caught my interest after my last heartbreak. When I looked at you — your smile, the way you acted — you just felt exactly like the kind of girl I’d always dreamed of. But I didn’t dare to get close... I was still scared to start getting close to anyone again.
                </p>
                <h3>The Moment That Stuck With Me</h3>
                <p>
                    During Janari, at the final rehearsal, I gave you ice cream. Honestly, I was so nervous. After the event ended, I finally got the courage to ask for a photo with you. Everyone started noticing we were getting close. Maybe you didn’t know, but I’m actually the type who gets scared easily—especially when it comes to girls. Scared you wouldn’t be interested, scared people would tease me, scared you’d say no. I had so many fears, but I still chose to be brave… because you’re the one I truly wanted to be with.

                        Do you remember our first date at Otwe? First time I picked you up, first time it was just the two of us. It was right after my senor photo session. I was so happy we finally met — especially after you said you'd think about it first before agreeing to meet me.

                        At Hooma, it was the first time I held your hand, the first time I leaned on you… and I swear, I felt so much love for you. It was the first time I really felt loved by a girl — first time holding a girl’s hand, being clingy, and actually feeling cared for like that.

                        I realize I’ve been really bad at handling my emotions.
                        I’ve made decisions when I was upset, said things that ended up hurting you...
                        Maybe even made you feel scared of me.
                        I didn’t fight hard enough to keep you, and I know that made you feel like I didn’t love you as much as I said I did.
                        I get upset too easily over the little things—and I hate that I made you feel that way.

                        I’m really sorry again,
                        I know I messed up, and I truly regret it.
                        Ever since that moment, my heart’s been heavy every single day—
                        because I hate that I hurt you, the person I love most.
                        You didn’t deserve any of it, and I wish I could take it all back and hold you tight instead.

                        I promise I’ll change.
                        No more being moody over small things.
                        I’ll learn to manage my emotions better, stay calm even when I’m upset,
                        and think before I speak—especially when I’m emotional.
                        Most of all, I promise I’ll hold on to you, no matter what… for as long as I live.

                    Wishing all your dreams come true, with a smooth journey and the right people by your side. You’ve got this — and just so you know, I’ll always be one of those people, quietly cheering you on, loving you in every step, even from afar
                </p>
                <p>
                     I hope your days ahead are happier than the ones before. And when things get tough, I hope everything feels a little lighter, knowing someone out there really cares about you — me. You deserve soft days, warm smiles, and all the love your heart can hold
                </p>
                <p>
                    I hope you keep getting stronger as you go through life. I know you wanna make your family proud — especially being the firstborn, I get how heavy that pressure can be. But hang in there, okay? Keep going, but don’t forget to rest too. And please, don’t skip meals — don’t let your GERD act up again
